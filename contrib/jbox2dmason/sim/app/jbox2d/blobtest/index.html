<h2>Blob Test</h2>
By Sean Luke

<p>This is a basic code-for-code replication of JBox2D's BlobTest example.  If you have installed the JBox2D jar files which come with the MASON package, you can compare the replication against the JBox2D demo application, which you can run as <tt>java org/jbox2d/testbed/framework/TestbedMain</tt>

<p>Note that there is a known bug in JBox2D's BlobTest code -- if you move the blob moderately far from the origin, it doesn't work right.
