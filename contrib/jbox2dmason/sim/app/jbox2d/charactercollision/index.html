<h2>Character Collision</h2>
By Sean Luke

<p>This is a basic code-for-code replication of JBox2D's CharacterCollision example.  If you have installed the JBox2D jar files which come with the MASON package, you can compare the replication against the JBox2D demo application, which you can run as <tt>java org/jbox2d/testbed/framework/TestbedMain</tt>

<p>There is a slight deviation in the MASON code because the default CharacterCollision example doesn't set the body location of three boxes correctly.
