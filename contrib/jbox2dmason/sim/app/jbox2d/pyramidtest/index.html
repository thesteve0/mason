<h2>Pyramid Test</h2>
By Sean Luke

<p>This is a basic code-for-code replication of JBox2D's PyramidTest example.  If you have installed the JBox2D jar files which come with the MASON package, you can compare the replication against the JBox2D demo application, which you can run as <tt>java org/jbox2d/testbed/framework/TestbedMain</tt>

<p>Note that if you move a block, in MASON the block is moved but momentum is not added to it (for now).  In the JBox2D demo example, momentum is added.
