This is version 0 of the MASON JBox2D code, which enables 2D constraint-based
rigid body kinematics.  This package marries MASON with JBox2D, a rigid
body kinematics package written in pure Java.  JBox2D is a reasonably faithful
port of (C++) LiquidFun, a Google extension to (C++) Box2D, a classic
rigid body kinematics tool.  You've seen Box2D in action before: it's the
physics system behind Angry Birds.

Okay, that was a lot of packages.  Here are the URLs:

JBox2D		https://github.com/jbox2d
LiquidFun	https://github.com/google/liquidfun
Box2D		http://box2d.org

To install this package, just add the jbox2dmason directory to your CLASSPATH.
Alternatively, you can create a jar file (with make jar) and stick it
in your CLASSPATH.  A jar file is already provided in the 'jar' directory.

You will also need to install several JBox2D jar files.  They are located
in the 'install' directory.

Four demo examples are provided.  These are largely code-for-code copies
of standard JBox2D examples:

sim.app.jbox2d.blobtest.BlobTestWithUI
sim.app.jbox2d.pyramidtest.PyramidTestWithUI
sim.app.jbox2d.dominotower.DominoTowerWithUI
sim.app.jbox2d.charactercollision.CharacterCollisionWithUI

We use this code internally to do robot simulation, so if you ask really
nicely we might provide more sophisticated usage examples.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to post them to the
MASON-INTEREST mailing list.
