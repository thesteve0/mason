<h2>Physics Sample: Pendulum</h2> 
By Christian Thompson

<p>In this tutorial, we set up a pendulum simulation in which a rectangle pendulum swings freely from a circular anchor under the force of gravity. The pendulum is attached to the anchor using a pin joint. The pin joint is a type of constraint - something that restricts the motion of the objects it affects.
