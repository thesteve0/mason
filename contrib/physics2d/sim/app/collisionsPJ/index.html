<h2>Physics Sample: Hinge Joint</h2> 
By Christian Thompson
</table>



<p>Sample which shows a hinge joint reacting to collisions.


<p><hr><font color='red'>Note:</font> this description is different from the one which appears after following the tutorial documentation.  This is because the tutorial documentation overrides the <tt>getInfo</tt> method to provide a description.  If this method is not overridden, MASON instead tries to display a file called <tt>index.html</tt> stored in the same directory as the simulation (which is what's going on here).
